                    Used Kotlin extensively to implement clean code, developing spring boot microservices and multi-layered architectures. Implemented asynchronous non-blocking code using co-routines. Provided over 90% code coverage on implementations. Improved latency of API endpoints by using active Redis clusters. Worked across primary and away teams to integrate and streamline the incorporation to existing services such as Order Management and Checkout steps. Implemented, documented, and tested the logic to evaluate loyalty program promotions within the core promotions engine.

                  Designed and developed software solutions for various clients. During my time there, I used several technologies including Spring Boot, Docker, React, Angular, and MongoDB. I played a key role in developing highly scalable and performant web applications using Spring Boot and Docker. Gained Experience in using Spring Data main modules like Hibernate, JPA, REST, and Elastic search.	I oversaw the migration of over 5 monolithic large-scale applications to cloud-hosted microservices using Spring Boot and Rest APIs.
