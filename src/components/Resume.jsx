                    I was responsible for designing and developing software
                    solutions for various clients across industries. I have

                    Spring Boot, Docker, AWS EC2, S3, React, Angular, MongoDB,

                  I oversaw migration of many monolithic applications to
                      cloud-hosted microservices using Spring Boot and Rest
                      APIs. In addition to frontend and backend development, I
                      have experience in working with various databases such as
                      MongoDB, Redis, and Elasticsearch. I have expertise in
                      designing and optimizing database schemas to ensure
                      maximum performance and scalability.
